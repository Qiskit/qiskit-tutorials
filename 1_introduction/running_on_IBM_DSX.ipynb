    "\n",
    "This example is copied from the original [getting_started.ipynb](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/1_introduction/getting_started.ipynb). It is tweaked (changes in the first code cell), so that it can be directly run using [IBM Data Science Experience](datascience.ibm.com) (IBM DSX). If you want to run other Quantum notebooks using IBM DSX, simply copy the first *code cell* and paste it at the beginning of your *other* notebook.\n",

    "### About IBM Data Science Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM Data Science Experience (IBM DSX) is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to activate their insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you just starting with QISkit and looking for a webhosted Jupyter notebook environment, IBM DSX is an excellent option. It is fairly easy to get your quantum notebook running in the Jupyter notebook environment provided by IBM DSX. Moreover, it provides a platform where you can create your Quantum notebooks, invite fellow researchers to collaborate or simply share your work within the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What you need to do\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates how to tweak your notebook so that it is ready to be run using IBM DSX. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In the first code cell, make sure to update the value of **`QX_API_token`** See the heading below that instructs how to get this information. \n",
    "* To run any other Quantum experience notebooks in IBM  DSX, just copy the first *code cell* of this notebook and paste it as the first *code cell* of your '*other*' notebook then just run it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting your API token\n",
    "\n",
    "The API access token allows you to connect to the IBM Quantum Experience API.  Here is how you can obtain this personal API access token.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you do not have an account for [IBM Q experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net) yet, sign up for one by following the instructions . \n",
    "2. Login to [IBM Q experience](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net).\n",
    "3. Click on your username that is displayed near the top right corner, and select *My Account*\n",
    "4. The *My Account* page has a section called *Personal Access Token* . Just copy the token displayed there. \n",
    "5. Update the value of **`QX_API_TOKEN`** in the first code cell with this API token you just copied in previous step.\n",

    "The basic concept of our quantum program is an array of quantum circuits. The program workflow consists of three stages: [Build](#sectionB), [Compile](#sectionC), and [Run](#sectionR). Build allows you to make different quantum circuits that represent the problem you are solving; Compile allows you to rewrite them to run on different backends (simulators/real chips of different [quantum volumes](http://ibm.biz/qiskit-quantum-volume), sizes, fidelity, etc); and Run launches the jobs.  After the jobs have been run, the data is collected. There are methods for putting this data together, depending on the program. This either gives you the answer you wanted, or allows you to make a better program for the next instance.\n",
