    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome QISKitters to the Quantum Information Software Kit ([QISKit](https://www.qiskit.org/) for short)! To get started we have put together a set of tutorials which can be downloaded by clicking [here!](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/archive/master.zip).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contents\n",
    "We have organised the tutorials into three sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. [Hello, Quantum World](hello_world/)\n",
    "Since quantum computing is so new to most users, we want to find the best *Hello Quantum World* program and welcome submissions here. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. [Reference](reference/)<a id='reference'></a>\n",
    "We've collected a core reference set of notebooks in this section. These notebooks demonstrate how to use QISKit and explore quantum information science, acting as a reference guide for QISKit. We will be keeping them up to date with QISKit. They are organized into the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.1 [Getting started with QISKit](reference/tools)\n",
    "In this first topic, we introduce you to the basic features of QISKit. More tutorials covering QISKit features can be found in [here](#appendix_tools) and developer documentation can be found [here](https://www.qiskit.org/documentation/).\n",
    "  * [Write and run your first quantum program](reference/tools/getting_started.ipynb) - how to use QISKit.\n",
    "  * [Working with different backends](reference/tools/working_with_backends.ipynb) - running a quantum program on different backends.\n",
    "  * [Using different gates](reference/tools/quantum_gates_and_linear_algebra.ipynb) - list of gates in QISKit and their linear algebra.\n",
    "  * [Visualisation of quantum states](reference/tools/visualizing_quantum_state.ipynb) -  illustrates the different tools we have for visualizing a quantum state.\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### 2.2 [Introduction to quantum information science](reference/qis)\n",
    "The next set of notebooks shows how you can explore some simple concepts of quantum information science. More tutorials on other quantum information science concepts can be found [here](#appendix_qis)\n",
    "  * [Superposition and entanglement](reference/qis/superposition_and_entanglement.ipynb) - this tutorial shows you how to make simple quantum states on one and two qubits, and demonstrates concepts such as quantum superpositions and entanglement.\n",
    "  * [Entanglement revisited](reference/qis/entanglement_revisited.ipynb) - this tutorial delves deeper into quantum entanglement, looking at the CHSH inequality and Mermin's test.\n",
    "  * [Quantum teleportation and superdense coding](reference/qis/teleportation_superdensecoding.ipynb) - this tutorial introduces two simple quantum communication protocols, based on the quantum entanglement. \n",
    "    \n",
    "####  2.3 [Understanding your quantum computer](reference/qcvv)\n",
    "This set of notebooks decribe a few of the techniques used to characterise, verify and validate quantum systems. \n",
    "  * [Relaxation and decoherence](reference/qcvv/relaxation_and_decoherence.ipynb) - how to measure coherence times on the real quantum hardware\n",
    "  * [Quantum state tomography](reference/qcvv/state_tomography.ipynb) - how to identify a quantum state using state tomography, in which the state is prepared repeatedly and measured in different bases\n",
    "  * [Quantum process tomography](reference/qcvv/process_tomography.ipynb) - using quantum process tomography to reconstruct the behavior of a quantum process and measure its fidelity, i.e. how closely it matches the ideal version\n",
    "  * Randomized Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "####  2.4 [Working on approximate quantum computers](reference/approximate)\n",
    "Universal fault tolerant quantum computers are still many years away, notebooks in this section describe a few of the things you can do with the approximate quantum computers we have today. Other examples can be found [here](#appendix_algorithms).\n",
    "  * [Variational Quantum Eigensolver](reference/approximate/quantum_chemistry.ipynb) - how to perform quantum chemistry \n",
    "  * Small error correcting codes\n",
    "  * Error mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.5 [Examples of quantum algorithms](reference/algorithms)\n",
    "This section contains notebooks describing the canonical quantum algorithms. Other quantum algorithms can be found [here](#appendix_algorithms).\n",
    "  * [Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm](reference/algorithms/deutsch_josza.ipynb) - a deterministic quantum algorithm that outperforms the corresponding classical algorithm.\n",
    "  * [Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm](reference/algorithms/bernstein_vazirani.ipynb) - a quantum algorithm that outperforms classical probabilistic algorithms.\n",
    "  * [Phase estimation](reference/algorithms/iterative_phase_estimation_algorithm.ipynb) - a quantum algorithm to extract eigenvalues of unknown unitary operator.\n",
    "  * Simon's algorithm\n",
    "  * [Grover's algorithm](reference/algorithms/grover_algorithm.py) - a Python program for running Grover's search on 3 qubits. \n",
    "  * Shor's algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "####  2.6 [Having fun with quantum computers](reference/games)\n",
    "Here we have a few examples of quantum games. Enjoy!\n",
    "  * [Battleships](reference/games/battleships_with_partial_NOT_gates.ipynb) - a version of Battleships made to run on ibmqx2. The unique properties of single qubit operations are used to implement the game mechanics, with the destruction of a ship corresponding to rotation from 0 to 1.\n",
    "  * [Which is the counterfeit coin?](reference/games/quantum_counterfeit_coin_problem.ipynb) - can you solve the counterfeit coin riddle? You are given a quantum computer and quantum beam balance, and your task is to find a counterfeit coin hidden in a set of coins. Armed with the knowledge of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, you can easily find the counterfeit coin using the beam balance only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. [Appendix](appendix)<a id='appendix'></a>\n",
    "This is where the rest of the tutorials are. They are not guaranteed to work with the latest version of the QISKit. They are organised into various topics:\n",
