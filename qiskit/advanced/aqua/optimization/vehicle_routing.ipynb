    "## The Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistics is a major industry, with some estimates valuing it at USD 8183 billion globally in 2015. Most service providers operate a number of vehicles (e.g., trucks and container ships), a number of depots, where the vehicles are based overnight, and serve a number of client locations with each vehicle during each day. There are many optimisation and control problems that consider these parameters. Computationally, the key challenge is how to design routes from depots to a number of client locations and back to the depot, so as to minimise vehicle-miles travelled, time spent, or similar objective functions. In this notebook we formalise an idealised version of the problem and showcase its solution using the quantum approximate optimization approach of Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutman (2014). \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall workflow we demonstrate comprises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. establish the client locations. Normally, these would be available ahead of the day of deliveries from a database. In our use case, we generate these randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. compute the pair-wise distances, travel times, or similar. In our case, we consider the Euclidean distance, \"as the crow flies\", which is perhaps the simplest possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. compute the actual routes. This step is run twice, actually. First, we obtain a reference value by a run of a classical solver (IBM CPLEX) on the classical computer. Second, we run an alternative, hybrid algorithm partly on the quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. visualisation of the results. In our case, this is again a simplistic plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we first explain the model, before we proceed with the installation of the pre-requisites and the data loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Model \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically speaking, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial problem, wherein the best routes from a depot to a number of clients and back to the depot are sought, given a number of available vehicles. There are a number of formulations possible, extending a number of formulations of the travelling salesman problem [Applegate et al, 2006]. Here, we present a formulation known as MTZ [Miller, Tucker, Zemlin, 1960]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n$ be the number of clients (indexed as $1,\\dots,n$), and $K$ be the number of available vehicles. Let $x_{ij} = \\{0,1\\}$ be the binary decision variable which, if it is $1$, activates the segment from node $i$ to node $j$. The node index runs from $0$ to $n$, where $0$ is (by convention) the depot. There are twice as many distinct decision variables as edges. For example, in a fully connected graph, there are $n(n+1)$ binary decision variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "If two nodes $i$ and $j$ have a link from $i$ to $j$, we write $i \\sim j$. We also denote with $\\delta(i)^+$ the set of nodes to which $i$ has a link, i.e., $j \\in \\delta(i)^+$ if and only if $i \\sim j$. Similarly, we denote with \n",
    "$\\delta(i)^-$ the set of nodes which are connected to $i$, in the sense that $j \\in \\delta(i)^-$ if and only if $j \\sim i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we consider continuous variables, for all nodes $i = 1,\\dots, n$, denoted $u_i$. These variables are needed in the MTZ formulation of the problem to eliminate sub-tours between clients. \n",
    "\n",
    "The VRP can be formulated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(VRP) \\quad  f = \\min_{\\{x_{ij}\\}_{i\\sim j}\\in \\{0,1\\}, \\{u_i\\}_{i=1,\\dots,n}\\in \\mathbb{R}} \\quad \\sum_{i \\sim j} w_{ij} x_{ij}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to the node-visiting constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{j \\in \\delta(i)^+} x_{ij} = 1, \\,\\sum_{j \\in \\delta(i)^-} x_{ji} = 1,\\, \\forall i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the depot-visiting constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i \\in \\delta(0)^+} x_{0i} = K, \\, \\sum_{j \\in \\delta(0)^+} x_{j0} = K,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the sub-tour elimination constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u_i - u_j + Q x_{ij} \\leq Q-q_j, \\, \\forall i \\sim j, \\,i ,j \\neq 0, \\quad q_i \\leq u_i \\leq Q,\\, \\forall i, i \\neq 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, \n",
    "- The cost function is linear in the cost functions and weighs the different arches based on a positive weight $w_{ij}>0$ (typically the distance between node $i$ and node $j$);\n",
    "- The first set of constraints enforce that from and to every client, only one link is allowed;\n",
    "- The second set of constraints enforce that from and to the depot, exactly  $K$ links are allowed;\n",
    "- The third set of constraints enforce the sub-tour elimination constraints and are bounds on $u_i$, with $Q>q_j>0$, and $Q,q_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classical solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We can solve the VRP classically, e.g., by using CPLEX. CPLEX uses a branch-and-bound-and-cut method to find an approximate solution of the VRP, which, in this formulation, is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). For the sake of notation, we pack the decision variables in one vector as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\bf z} = [x_{01},x_{02},\\ldots,x_{10}, x_{12},\\ldots,x_{n(n-1)}]^T,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "wherein ${\\bf z} \\in \\{0,1\\}^N$, with $N = n (n+1)$. So the dimension of the problem scales quadratically with the number of nodes. Let us denote the optimal solution by ${\\bf z}^*$, and the associated optimal cost $f^*$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we demonstrate an approach that combines classical and quantum computing steps, following the quantum approximate optimization approach of Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutman (2014). In particular, we use the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We stress that given the use of limited depth of the quantum circuits employed (variational forms), it is hard to discuss the speed-up of the algorithm, as the solution obtained is heuristic in nature. At the same time, due to the nature and importance of the target problems, it is worth investigating heuristic approaches, which may be worthwhile for some problem classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following [5], the algorithm can be summarised as follows:\n",
    "- Preparation steps: \n",
    "\t- Transform the combinatorial problem into a binary polynomial optimization problem with equality constraints only;\n",
    "\t- Map the resulting problem into an Ising Hamiltonian ($H$) for variables ${\\bf z}$ and basis $Z$, via penalty methods if necessary;\n",
    "\t- Choose the depth of the quantum circuit $m$. Note that the depth can be modified adaptively.\n",
    "\t- Choose a set of controls $\\theta$ and make a trial function $\\big|\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\rangle$, built using a quantum circuit made of C-Phase gates and single-qubit Y rotations, parameterized by the components of $\\boldsymbol\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm steps: \n",
    "\t- Evaluate $C(\\boldsymbol\\theta) = \\langle\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\big|H\\big|\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\rangle$ by sampling the outcome of the circuit in the Z-basis and adding the expectation values of the individual Ising terms together. In general, different control points around $\\boldsymbol\\theta$ have to be estimated, depending on the classical optimizer chosen.\n",
    "\t- Use a classical optimizer to choose a new set of controls.\n",
    "\t- Continue until $C(\\boldsymbol\\theta)$ reaches a minimum, close enough to the solution $\\boldsymbol\\theta^*$.\n",
    "\t- Use the last $\\boldsymbol\\theta$ to generate a final set of samples from the distribution $\\Big|\\langle z_i\\big|\\psi(\\boldsymbol\\theta)\\rangle\\Big|^2\\;\\forall i$ to obtain the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many parameters throughout, notably the choice of the trial wavefunction. Below, we consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\big|\\psi(\\theta)\\rangle = [U_\\mathrm{single}(\\boldsymbol\\theta) U_\\mathrm{entangler}]^m \\big|+\\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U_\\mathrm{entangler}$ is a collection of C-Phase gates (fully-entangling gates), and $U_\\mathrm{single}(\\theta) = \\prod_{i=1}^N Y(\\theta_{i})$, where $N$ is the number of qubits and $m$ is the depth of the quantum circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Construct the Ising Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "From $VRP$ one can construct a binary polynomial optimization with equality constraints only by considering cases in which $K=n-1$. In these cases the sub-tour elimination constraints are not necessary and the problem is only on the variable ${\\bf z}$. In particular, we can write an augmented Lagrangian as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(IH) \\quad H = \\sum_{i \\sim j} w_{ij} x_{ij}  + A \\sum_{i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}} \\Big(\\sum_{j \\in \\delta(i)^+} x_{ij} - 1\\Big)^2 + A \\sum_{i \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}}\\Big(\\sum_{j \\in \\delta(i)^-} x_{ji} - 1\\Big)^2 +A \\Big(\\sum_{i \\in \\delta(0)^+} x_{0i} - K\\Big)^2 + A\\Big(\\sum_{j \\in \\delta(0)^+} x_{j0} - K\\Big)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A$ is a big enough parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "### From Hamiltonian to QP formulation \n",
    "\n",
    "In the vector ${\\bf z}$, and for a complete graph ($\\delta(i)^+ = \\delta(i)^- = \\{0,1,\\dots,i-1,i+1,\\dots,n\\}$), $H$ can be written as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Keep in mind that VQE is an heuristic working on the QP formulation of the Ising Hamiltonian, though. For suitable choices of A, local optima of the QP formulation will be feasible solutions to the ILP. While for some small instances, as above, we can find optimal solutions of the QP formulation which coincide with optima of the ILP, finding optimal solutions of the ILP is harder than finding local optima of the QP formulation, in general, which in turn is harder than finding feasible solutions of the ILP. Even within the VQE, one may provide stronger guarantees, for specific variational forms (trial wave functions). \n",
