    "## Introduction\n",
    "There has been a growing interest in using quantum computers to find solutions of combinatorial problems. A heuristic approach for finding solutions of combinatorial problems on quantum computers is the quantum variational approach, such as the Variational Quantum \n",
    "Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00171 and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4028). In order to use a quantum variational approach on quantum computers, first, we need to map a combinatorial problem to an Ising Hamiltonian. However Ising Hamiltonians are complicated and unintuitive. Mapping a combinatorial problem to Ising Hamiltonians can be a difficult and time-consuming task, requiring specialized knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we introduce a translator to automatically generate Ising Hamiltonians from classical optimization models. We will explain about classical optimization models later. The translator dramatically simplifies the task of designing and implementing quantum-computing-based solutions, for optimization problems, by automatically generating Ising Hamiltonians for different optimization problems. With the translator, all a user has to do is to write optimization models using DOcplex (see https://cdn.rawgit.com/IBMDecisionOptimization/docplex-doc/master/docs/index.html). DOcplex is a python library for optimization problems.\n",
    "Then the translator will automatically generate Ising Hamiltonians from the models. Optimization models are short and intuitive. It is much easier to write optimization models compared to writing Ising Hamiltonians manually. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum variational approach works with the translator in Qiskit Aqua as follows:\n",
    "1. Write an optimization model of the formulation with DOcplex.\n",
    "2. Call the translator to transform the model into an Ising Hamiltonian.\n",
    "3. Solve the problem with variational algorithms such as VQE and QAOA.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Details of Optimization Models\n",
    "The translator supports the generation of an Ising Hamiltonian from the following optimization model elements:\n",
    "- Binary decision variables. \n",
    "- Linear and quadratic terms in objective functions.\n",
    "- Only equality constraints.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Input models are validated before transformation. If the model contains elements that are not from the supported set, an error will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there are restrictions, this type of optimization model can handle optimization problems such as max-cut, traveling salesman etc.\n",
    "These are typical optimization problems. Examples of the translator being used for Max-Cut and TSP problems can be found in the following tutorial:\n",
