    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In asset management, there are broadly two approaches: active and passive investment management. Within passive investment management, there are index-tracking funds and there are approaches based on portfolio diversification, which aim at representing a portfolio with large number of assets by a smaller number of representative stocks.\n",
    "This notebook illustrates a portfolio diversification problem, which has recently become popular for two reasons:\n",
    "1. it makes it possible to mimick the performance of an index (or a similarly large set of assets) with a limited budget, at limited transaction costs. That is: traditional index-tracking may purchase all assets in the index, ideally with the same weights as in the index. This may be impractical for a number of reasons: the total of even a single round lot per asset may amount to more than the assets under management, the large scale of the index-tracking problem with integrality constraints may render the optimisation problem difficult, and the transaction costs of the frequent rebalancing to adjust the positions to the weights in the index may render the approach expensive. Thus, a popular approach is to select a portfolio of $q$ assets that represent the market with $n$ assets, where $q$ is significantly smaller than $n$, but where the portfolio replicates the behaviour of the underlying market. To determine how to group assets into $q$ clusters and how to determine which $q$ assets should represent the $q$ clusters amounts to solving a large-scale optimization problem. In the following we describe the mathematical model for the portfolio diversification problem as introduced in [Cornuejols & Tutuncu, 2006] \n",
    "2. it allows for similarity measures between time-series beyond the covariance matrix. Notice that traditionally, modern portfolio theory considers the covariance matrix as measure of similarity between the assets. As such, however, covariance matrix is imperfect. Consider, for instance, a company listed both in London and New York. Although both listings should be very similar, only parts of the time series of the prices of the two listings will overlap, because of the partial overlap of the times the markets open. Instead of covariance, one can consider, for example, dynamic time warping of [Berndt and Clifford, 1994] as a measure of similarity between two time series, which allows for the fact that for some time periods, the data are captured by only one of the time series, while for others, both time series exhibit the similarity due to the parallel evolution of the stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall workflow we demonstrate comprises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pick the ground set of assets. In our case, this is a small number of US stocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. load the time series capturing the evolution of the prices of assets. In our case, this is an simplistic load of adjusted daily closing price data from Wikipedia or Nasdaq or LSE or EuroNext, whereas in a real asset management, a much higher frequency may be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. compute the pair-wise similarity among the time series. In our case, we run a linear-time approximation of the dynamic time warping, still on the classical computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. compute the actual portfolio of $q$ representative assets, based on the similarity measure. This step is run twice, actually. First, we obtain a reference value by a run of an IBM solver (IBM ILOG CPLEX or the Exact Eigensolver) on the classical computer. Second, we run an alternative, hybrid algorithm partly on the quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. visualisation of the results. In our case, this is again a simplistic plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we first explain the model used in (4) above, before we proceed with the installation of the pre-requisites and the data loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in [Cornuejols & Tutuncu, 2006], we describe a mathematical model that clusters assets into groups of similar ones and selects one representative asset from each group to be included in the index fund portfolio. The model is based on the following data, which we will discuss in more detail later:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho_{ij} = \\textrm{similarity}\\, \\textrm{between}\\, \\textrm{stock}\\, i \\, \\textrm{and}\\, \\textrm{stock}\\, j.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $\\rho_{ii} = 1$, $\\rho_{ij} \\leq  1$ for $i \\neq j$ and $\\rho_{ij}$ is larger for more similar stocks. An example of this is the correlation between the returns of stocks $i$ and $j$. But one could choose other similarity indices $\\rho_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem that we are interested in solving is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(M) \\quad  f = \\max_{x_{ij}, y_{j}} \\,\\, \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\rho_{ij} x_{ij}\n",

    "to consistency constraints:\n",

    "\\quad x_{jj} = y_j,\\,\\textrm{ for }\\,  j = 1,\\ldots, n,\n",

    "The variables $y_j$ describe which stocks $j$ are in the index fund ($y_j = 1$ if $j$ is selected in the fund, $0$ otherwise). For each stock $i = 1,\\dots,n$, the variable $x_{ij}$ indicates which stock $j$ in the index fund is most similar to $i$ ($x_{ij} = 1$ if $j$ is the most similar stock in the index fund, $0$ otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first constraint selects $q$ stocks in the fund. The second constraint imposes that each stock $i$ has exactly one representative stock $j$ in the fund. The third and fourth constraints guarantee that stock $i$ can be represented by stock $j$ only if $j$ is in the fund. The objective of the model maximizes the similarity between the $n$ stocks and their representatives in the fund. Different cost functions can also be considered. \n",

    "Solution shows the selected stocks via the stars and in green the links (via similarities) with other stocks that are represented in the fund by the linked stock. Keep in mind that VQE is an heuristic working on the QP formulation of the Ising Hamiltonian, though. For suitable choices of A, local optima of the QP formulation will be feasible solutions to the ILP. While for some small instances, as above, we can find optimal solutions of the QP formulation which coincide with optima of the ILP, finding optimal solutions of the ILP is harder than finding local optima of the QP formulation, in general. Even within the VQE, one may provide stronger guarantees, for specific variational forms (trial wave functions). "
