    "# Qiskit Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome Qiskitters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These tutorials aim to explain how to use Qiskit. We assume you have installed Qiskit; if not, please look at [qiskit.org](http://www.qiskit.org) or the install [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of these notebooks is not on learning quantum computing.  Instead we will focus on how to use Qiskit, and will go into details only when needed. For those interested in learning about quantum computing we recommend the [Qiskit Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook) that we and the community have put together, or the [Qiskit documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation).\n",
