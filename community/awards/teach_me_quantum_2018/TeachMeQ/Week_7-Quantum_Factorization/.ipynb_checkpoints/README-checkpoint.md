# Week 7 - Quantum Factorization (Shor's Algorithm)

 * The Prime Factorization Problem
 * Cryptography Considerations
 * Grover's Algorithm Overview
 * Shor's Algorithm
 * From Factorization to Period Finding
 * Quantum Fourier Transform
 * From Period to Factors

# Exercises
 * [Jupyter notebook 1 with tutorial](exercises/w7_01.ipynb): understanding the Quantum Fourier Transform on its own (this one is optional as it is very math-heavy for some students)
 * [Jupyter notebook 2 with tutorial](exercises/w7_02.ipynb): understanding Shor's Algorithm step by step

## Resources
 * [PDF slides](slides.pdf)
 * [slides src](latex/) Latex files and image resources used in the presentation (useful for PR on slide typos and such)
