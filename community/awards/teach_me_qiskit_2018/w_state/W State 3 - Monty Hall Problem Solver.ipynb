    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Monty Hall problem has been approached by various formulations related to quantum game theory (notably Fittney and Abbott 2002, D'Ariano et al., 2002). It is no wonder that Alice and Bob come now on stage, the first as the game master, the second as the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, a quantum model of the Monty Hall's game adapted for the ibmqx5 architecture will be built in three phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, a circuit comprising two sets of three qubits entangled in a state W will be used to materialize the actions of Alice and Bob and tested in a simulation of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a second step, three Toffoli gates will be added to this circuit to establish a solution in which the measurement of a single qubit a sufficient number of run will be enough to determine the chances of gain Bob according to whether he prefers to stick with his first intention or switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a final step, Bob's mood for sticking or switching will gradually change from one experiment to the next to see how this can modify his probability of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by choosing the backend first. A simulator is always preferable during the first tests."

    "\n",
    "The first W state involving the qubits $q_l$, $q_c$ and $q_r$ represents Alice's choice of the door behind which to hide the car (in the following two equations, the subscrits $l$, $c$ and $r$ represents respectively the left, center and right door):\n",

    "\n",
    "The second W state involving the qubits $q_l^{*}$, $q_c^{*}$ and $q_r^{*}$ represents Bob's initial choice regarding the door behind which the car would hide:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |W^{*} \\rangle \\: =\\: \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\: (|1_{l}^{*} 0_{c}^{*} 0_{r}^{*} \\rangle \\: + \\: |0_{l}^{*} 1_{c}^{*} 0_{r}^{*}\\rangle \\: +\\:  |0_{l}^{*} 0_{c}^{*} 1_{r}^{*}\\rangle) $$\n",

    "A last circuit establishes a flag $q_s$ representing Bob's decision to stick with his initial choice (ground state) or to switch (excited state). A Hadamard gate applied to $q_s$  ensures the equiprobability of these possibilities.\n"

    "## The Mood of Bob\n",
    "\n",
    "After this experimental demonstration of the superiority of the strategy of systematic switching on systematic sticking, in agreement with a theory that is highly counterintuitive but certainly mathematically correct and generally accepted, one could consider that all is said and done.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it has not been experimentally demonstrated in this tutorial that there is not yet a better strategy between these two extremes. In order to reach a final conclusion, a series of experiments will follow, in which a gradual variation of the switch probability $P(s)$ is created. This equates to a gradual change in Bob's mood, from a propensity to stick with his first choice to an impetuous need to change his mind when given the opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, the qubit $q_s$ undergoes an incremental rotation around X-axis $R_x(\\lambda)$, according to the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda = 2\\arcsin \\sqrt{P(s)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the circuit is  completed by a $cNOT$ gate with $q_s$ as control and $q_w$ as target, the  measure of $q_w$ alone is sufficient to estimate the probability that Bob will win for a given propensity to switch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the results of eight experiments with incremental values of $P(s)$, each with a sufficient number of shots."

    "## Concluding remarks:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model presented here is a stand alone solution to the Monty Hall problem. All scenarios of the game remain in the realm of possibility as long as a measurement is not performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is further characterized by the use of multi-qubit gates. A circuit portion that creates a W state can be considered in its entirety as a three-qubit gate, which could be coined a $W$ gate. In the present case, two $W$ gates followed by three $C3$ gates make it possible to carry out the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monty Hall problem has a well-known classical solution, but nothing prevents us from imagining that this approach may be useful for certain problems for which a solution is impossible to achieve within a reasonable time by the conventional means of numerical calculation."
