    "Have you ever wanted to send a super secret message to a friend? Then you need a key to encrypt your message, and your friend needs the same key to decrypt your message. But, how do you send a super secret key to your friend without your eavesdropping enemies finding out what it is? Businesses and governments face this problem every day. People are always innovating new ways to intercept personal data or other sensitive information. Ideally, we'd like to find a way to share information that cannot be intercepted. [Quantum key distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_key_distribution) (QKD) was created as a solution to this problem. In this tutorial, you'll learn about and implement a version of the [BB84 QKD protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB84), developed by Bennet and Brassard, to generate a secure, [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad) encryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum key distribution is all about making the right information publicly known at the right times (and keeping the secret information secret). This tutorial will take you through a quantum key distribution between you (Alice) and your friend Bob. After you get a feel for the ropes by sending your first encrypted message to Bob, we'll introduce Eve--your eavesdropping enemy. You'll learn how to detect Eve's presence and thus prevent her from intercepting your super secret key and decrypting your messages."

    "# Part 2: Eve the Eavesdropper\n",
    "What if someone  is eavesdropping on Alice and Bob's line of communication? This process of random string making and rotations using quantum mechanics is only useful if it's robust against eavesdroppers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eve is your lurking enemy. She eavesdrops by intercepting your transmission to Bob. To be sneaky, Eve must send on the intercepted transmission--otherwise Bob will never receive anything and know that something is wrong!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain further why Eve can be detected. If Eve intercepts a qubit from Alice, she will not know if Alice rotated its state or not. Eve can only measure a 0 or 1. And she can't measure the qubit and then send the same qubit on, because her measurement will destroy the quantum state. Consequently, Eve doesn't know when or when not to rotate to recreate Alice's original qubit. She may as well send on qubits that have not been rotated, hoping to get the rotation right 50% of the time. After she sends these qubits to Bob, Alice and Bob can compare select parts of their keys to see if they have discrepancies in places they should not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheme goes as follows:\n",
    "1. Alice sends her qubit transmission Bob--but Eve measures the results\n",
    "2. To avoid suspicion, Eve prepares qubits corresponding to the bits she measured and sends them to Bob.\n",
    "3. Bob and Alice make their keys like normal\n",
    "4. Alice and Bob randomly select the same parts of their keys to share publicly\n",
    "5. If the selected part of the keys don't match, they know Eve was eavesdropping\n",
    "6. If the selected part of the keys DO match, they can be confident Eve wasn't eavesdropping\n",
    "7. They throw away the part of the key they made public and encrypt and decrypt super secret messages with the portion of the key they have left.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"QKD.png\">\n",
    "Here we see Alice sending her qubits, rotationing them based on her rotation string, and Eve intercepting the transmittion. Eve then sending her results onto Bob who--like normal--rotates and measures the qubits."
