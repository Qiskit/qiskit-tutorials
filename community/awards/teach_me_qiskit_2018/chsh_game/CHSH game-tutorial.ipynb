    "Quantum games are similar to probability games played in a casino. They usually involve several players who cooperatively play a game against the house (sometimes called referee). The players are given some random inputs, and they have to make a choice on which output to give back to the house. They are not allowed to communicate during the game, so they have to prepare a strategy in advance in order to have the best chance to win the game.\n",

For now, just think of it as the kinds of manipulations they are allowed to do. In classical strategies, they are only allowed to manipulate their inputs classically, that is with the help of objects whose behaviour can be described using classical physics. In quantum strategies, they are allowed to use quantum objects (which follow the rules of quantum mechanics) to manipulate the inputs given to them.\n"

    "## Quantum computation\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computation is a new kind of computation which differs from the current way of doing computations in the same way quantum strategies differ from classical strategies.\n",
    "Classical computations can be implemented in several ways, the most successful one today is the circuit model of computation. This is how elements in modern computers are designed. In the circuit model, a computation is made by taking a string of bits as inputs, doing certain operations on them and giving a new string of bits as output. In the current paradigm, these operation are logical operations that follow Boole's logic. It was proved that one needs to be able to carry out a limited set of operation (namely \"not gate\", and \"and gate\") in order to implement any operation (addition, multiplication, division, ... ) by a combination of operation from this set. This fundamental set of gates is called an \"elementary set of gates\" and is all that is required to be able to do any computation.\n",
    "Similarly to classical computation, quantum computation can be done using the circuit model of computation. In this case, bits are replaced by qubits and logic gates must be substituted with quantum gates which can operate on qubits while keeping intact their special quantum properties.\n",
    "Here there is another difference which we haven't mentioned, quantum circuits must be reversible due to the reversibility ineherent in the laws of quantum mechanics. A reversible circuit allows you to run the computation backwards and retrieve the inputs given the outputs. Classical computation can also be imnplemented using reversible gates but there are disadvanteges with regards to the circuit size and complexity. Thus modern computer are built with \"irreversible\" logic (which means it's impossible to run the computation backwards, see truth table of the \"AND\" gate for example) and this is the reason why the generate heat! In order to have reversible quantum gates, one must implement these gates using, what is called \"unitary operations\", that is operations which preserve the sum of the probabilities of seeing each of the measurable values of the qubits. Altough, the probability of seeing any single outcome can change, their sum will always add up to one. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Qubits\n",
    "\n",
    "In quantum computation the objects of the computation are quantum objects called qubits. Similarly to bits, qubits can take two values: \n",
    "$$\\lvert 0 \\rangle , \\lvert 1 \\rangle .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the brackets around the number points to the fact that these are quantum objects (see Dirac's notation).\n",
    "Differently from the regular bits stored in a computer, which can either take the value of \"0\" or \"1\", qubits can be in a superposition of \"0\" and \"1\".\n",
    "$$\\alpha \\lvert 0 \\rangle + \\beta \\lvert 1 \\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are complex numbers and are related to the probability of obtaining the corresponding outcome $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$ or $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(qubit \\, state = 0) = \\lvert \\alpha \\rvert^{2}$$\n",
    "$$P(qubit \\, state = 1) = \\lvert \\beta \\rvert^{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means the qubit has simultaneously the value \"0\" and \"1\" and, only when measured, will take one of the two values with probability $\\lvert \\alpha \\rvert^{2}$ and $\\lvert \\beta \\rvert^{2}$ respectively.\n",
    "Another interesting property of qubits, which departs from the classical world, is that they can be entangled. If qubits are entangled with each other, the value taken by each of them is strictly related to the value taken by the other. The correlations between the values of entangled qubits is so strong that it cannot be described by classical probability theory. This is one of the most peculiar features of quantum mechanics. In a way, entangled qubits lose their identity as individual objects, as their properties now depend on the properties of the other objects with which they are entangled. It's not possible to separate an entangled system in independent parts and it must be treated as a new unit (in quantum mechanical terms, the state of the whole system is not separable. it cannot be factorized as product state of the state of individual systems).\n",
    "However, in order to know about these quantum objects we must make a measurement of their state. This, causes the system to take one particular value among a set that are compatible to its state. It is not possible to determine with certainity which value the system will take, but one can only know the various probabilities for the allowed values and then sit back and watch what the system \"chooses\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum gates\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum gates implement operations on qubit by keeping intact their quantum properties. Furthermore, they allow some of those properties to arise, for example by putting qubits in a superposition of states or entangling with each other.\n",
    "Let's see some quantum gates:\n",
    "\n",
    "### One-qubit gates\n",
    "These gates act on a qubit, affecting its state:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>X</b>: flips the state of a qubit from $\\lvert 0 \\rangle \\rightarrow \\lvert 1 \\rangle $ and $\\lvert 1 \\rangle \\rightarrow \\lvert 0 \\rangle $  .\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Z</b>: flips the phase of a qubit (changes relative sign of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Y</b>: flips the state of a qubit and its phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>H</b>: puts qubit in a superposition of $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$  and $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Rotations around an axis ($R_x, R_y, R_z$)</b>: Rotates qubit, by changing the coefficients $\\alpha, \\beta$ in a way that depends on the angle of rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-qubit gates\n",
    "The most important two qubit gate is the controlled-not gate:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>CX</b>: flips the state of a qubit conditionally on the state of another qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more details, one of the qubit is taken as control qubit (and it is unaffected by the gate) and the other as target qubit. If the control qubit is in the state $\\lvert 0 \\rangle$, nothing is done to the target qubit. If the control qubit is in state $\\lvert 1 \\rangle$, the <b>X</b> gate (bit-flip) is apllied to the target qubit.\n"

    "\n",
    "The game involves two players (Alice and Bob) who play against the house.
