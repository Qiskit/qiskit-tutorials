# Quantum characterization, validation, verification and mitigation with Qiskit Ignis

In this folder we have a collection of great tutorials from our fantastic Qiskitters describing various concepts in quantum characterization, validation, verification and mitigation.

* [Incoherent Noise](coherence-overview.ipynb): Overview of common sources of incoherent noise on quantum devices (e.g. T1 and T2) and what experiments used used to measure these noise parameters.

* [Measurement Error and Mitigation](measurement_error_mitigation.ipynb): Introduction to measurement, assignment error and how to mitigate.

* [State and Process Tomography Overview](tomography-overview.ipynb): Introduction to state and process tomography and different representations of a quantum process.

* [Hamiltonian Parameters](hamiltonian.ipynb): Introduction to the Hamiltonian for a multi-qubit circuit and how the Hamiltonian transforms to the dressed basis, leads to dispersive shifts used for qubit state measurement and gives rise to ZZ.

* [Gate Errors](gate_errors.ipynb): Introduction to error amplification sequences and a derivation of the amplitude error amplification sequence fit function.

* [Randomized Benchmarking](RB_overview.ipynb): Introduction to randomized benchmarking (RB), which is a scalable technique for measuring the average gate error.

Quantum characterization is such an interesting topic and we have by no means covered everything! We welcome additional notebooks in the relevant folder.
