    "## The General Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum tomography is an experimental procedure to reconstruct a description of part of quantum system from the measurement outcomes of a specific set of experiments. In Qiskit Ignis we are currently concerned with the following two tomography tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Quantum state tomography**: Given a state-preparation circuit that prepares a system in a state, reconstruct a description of the density matrix $\\rho$.\n",
    "2. **Quantum process tomograhpy**: Given a circuit, reconstruct a description of the quantum channel $\\mathcal{E}$ that describes the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases we rely on the assumption that we have access to a large number of identical copies of the system and so can perform several different measures on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can roughly split the tomography process to three stages:\n",
    "1. Preperation: Add suitable initialization/measurement devices to the quantum system.\n",
    "2. Experiment: Obtain measurement data from the quantum system.\n",
    "3. Tomography: Use the obtained data to reconstruct the system's description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 1 and 2 are related to the quantum system being studied, whereas step 3 is a classical computation which can be carried out on standard computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## State Tomography Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum state tomography is a method of reconstructing a description of the quantum state of a system from a set of experiments. While the state of ideal quantum system is described by a state-vector the state of an open quantum system (one that may experiences noise or other errors) is given by a density matrix $\\rho$. Quantum state tomography aims to reconstruct this density matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we assume that the state $\\rho$ can be reliably prepared by a state-preparation circuit, and that itcan be subjected to several measurements with respect to different operators; this data can be used to reconstruct $\\rho$ or a close approximation of it by several different methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote by $\\mathcal{X}$ the state space of a closed (ideal) quantum system. In quantum computing this is typically the tensor product of $N$ 2-dimensional (qubit) systems $\\mathcal{X} = \\mathbb{C^{2N}}$. Valid quantum states $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{X}$ are those with norm-1:$|\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle|^2 = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We denote by $L(\\mathcal{X})$ the state space of linear maps on $\\mathcal{X}$, ($L: \\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{X}$). The density-matrix for quantum system with state space $\\mathcal{X}$ is a linear map $\\rho \\in L(\\mathcal{X})$ that is also positive-semidefinite, and has trace equal to 1:\n",
    "1. **Unit trace:** $\\text{tr}[\\rho] = 1$\n",
    "2. **Positive-semidefinite:**: For all $|\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{X}$, $\\langle\\psi|\\rho|\\psi\\rangle \\ge 0$. This is denoted by $\\rho \\ge 0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "A quantum process, or quantum channel, describes the fixed-time evolution of a density matrix $\\rho^\\prime = \\mathcal{E}(\\rho)$. While ideal quantum processes are described by unitary matrix evolution, general quantum process can include the effect of errors in the ideal evolution such as those due to unwanted interaction with an environment system, systematic errors in gate operations, or other error processes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum process tomography aims to find a description of $\\mathcal{E}$ from a set of experiments. Like state tomography, we measure with respect to several different bases. Process tomography also uses several different initial states, as opposed to state tomography where only $\\left|0^n\\right\\rangle$ is used. It can be thought of as performing state-tomography on tomographically complete set of a complete set of input states for the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $D(\\mathcal{X})$ be the set of density-matrices on a quantum system. Quantum channels are maps $\\mathcal{E}:L(\\mathcal{X})\\rightarrow L(\\mathcal{X})$ that are *completely positive-trace preserving* (CPTP):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CP:** $\\mathcal{E}$ is *completely-positive* if and only if $(\\mathcal{I}\\otimes\\mathcal{E})(\\rho)\\ge 0$ for all $\\rho \\ge 0$, where $\\mathcal{I}$ is an identity channel on an ancilla system.\n",

    "\n",
    "Together these two requirements ensure that the output of the quantum process will always be a valid density matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous representations for a quantum channel $\\mathcal{E}$. The simplest way to perform process tomogrpahy is to reconstruct a description of $\\mathcal{E}$ known as the *Choi-matrix* or process-matrix. This is because it is analogous to a density matrix $\\rho$, and hence the reconstruction is similar to quantum state tomography. Another common representation is the *Kraus* representation which we will also describe and show how it is related to the Choi-matrix. Another common representation is the Pauli Tranfer Matrix (PTM), which is useful for evolution since compositing channels becomes matrix multiplication. For more details about different representations of quantum channels and their relationships see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6950).\n",

    "#### Choi-matrix representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Choi-matrix description of a quantum channel $\\mathcal{E}$ is a unique bipartite matrix $\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{E}}\\in L(\\mathcal{X}\\otimes\\mathcal{X})$ given by the *Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism*.\n",
    "Given a basis $\\left\\{\\left|0\\right\\rangle, \\left|1\\right\\rangle,\\dots, \\left|n-1\\right\\rangle\\right\\}$ of $\\mathcal{X}$, the Choi-matrix $\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{E}}$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Evolution of a quantum state can be described in terms of this matrix by \n",
    "$$\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}_1[\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{E}}(\\rho^T\\otimes\\mathbb{1})]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{Tr}_1$ denotes **partial trace**: $\\text{Tr}_1[A\\otimes B] = \\text{Tr}[A]\\,B$ and $\\mathbb{1}$ is the identity operator on $X$.\n",

    "In terms of the Choi-matrix, the requirements that $\\mathcal{E}$ is CPTP are:\n",

    "where $\\text{Tr}_2$ denotes **partial trace**: $\\text{Tr}_2[A\\otimes B] =\\text{Tr}[B]\\,A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kraus representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Another commonly used description of a quantum channel $\\mathcal{E}$ is via **Kraus operators**. A set $\\left\\{K_1, K_2, \\dots, K_t\\right\\}$ such that $K_i \\in L(X)$. In terms of this representation the evolution of a state is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = \\sum_{i=1}^k K_i\\rho K_i^\\dagger$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the Kraus operators the requirement that $\\mathcal{E}$ is CPTP is equivalent to $\\sum_{i=1}^k K_i^\\dagger K_i = \\mathbb{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common description of quantum processes. In case of a unitary operator $U$, the set $\\left\\{U\\right\\}$ is a Kraus operator representation of it,\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{E}(\\rho) = U \\rho U^{\\dagger}$$\n",
    "Measurements and noises are also commonly given via Kraus operators. Note however that the Kraus representation of a quantum process is not unique.\n",

    "\n",
    "The CP condition on the Choi-matrix ($\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{E}})\\ge 0$ is equivalent to the state-tomography condition that a density matrix is positive-semidefinite. The only difference is that the normalization of the Choi-matrix is not trace-1, but trace given by the dimension of $\\mathcal{X}$ ($\\text{Tr}[\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{E}}] = d$). This allows us to use the same fitters from state-tomography to fit the Choi-matrix adjusting for this difference in normalization. *The key difference between state tomography is the TP condition which is an additional constraint we must add to the tomography fitters if we want to ensure the fitted channel is CPTP.*\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this relationship explicity consider preparing the system in an initial state $\\rho$ and measuring. The probability of measurement for a projector $\\Pi$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{ij} = \\text{Tr}[\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{E}}(\\rho^T\\otimes\\Pi_j)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above equation we can see that the act of measuring the outcome of $\\mathcal{E}$ on some initial $\\rho$ with some projector $\\Pi$ can be seen as the act of measuring $\\Lambda_\\mathcal{E}$ (when it is considered as a **state** in the space $L(\\mathcal{X}\\otimes\\mathcal{X})$) with a measurement operator $\\overline{\\rho}\\otimes \\Pi$, where we have used that $\\rho^T=\\overline{\\rho}$ since $\\rho$ is Hermitian.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives rise to the following algorithm for process tomography:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain a set of initial states $\\left\\{\\rho_1, \\dots \\rho_{k}\\right\\}$ and a set of projectors $\\left\\{P_1, \\dots P_{t}\\right\\}$ such that the set of all projectos $\\Pi_{i,j} = \\overline{\\rho_i}\\otimes P_j$ is tomographically complete for $L(\\mathcal{X}\\otimes\\mathcal{X})$.\n",
    "2. Obtain measurements of $\\Lambda_\\mathcal{E}$ with $\\Pi_{i,j}$ by initializing a system to $\\rho_{i}$, applying $\\mathcal{E}$ (e.g. via a simulator or the quantum computer to check) and measuring via $P_j$.\n",
    "3. Pass the results and the description of $\\Pi_{i,j}$ to an algorithm for state tomography and obtain $\\Lambda_\\mathcal{E}$. *Note that to ensure the fitted state is also TP requires adding the additional constraint to the fitter (if supported) that $\\text{Tr}_2[\\Lambda_{\\mathcal{E}}]=\\mathbb{1}$.*"
