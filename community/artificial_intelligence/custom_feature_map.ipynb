    "Support vector machines (SVM) address the problem of supervised learning through the construction of a classifier. Havlicek *et al*. proposed two strategies to design a quantum SVM, namely the Quantum Kernel Estimator and the Quantum Variational Classifier. Both of these strategies use data that is provided classically and encodes it in the quantum state space through a quantum feature map [1]. The choice of which feature map to use is important and may depend on the given dataset we want to classify. In this tutorial, we show how to configure new feature maps in Aqua and explore their impact on the accuracy of the quantum classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aqua provides several options for customizing the quantum feature map. In particular, there are four main parameters that can be used for model selection: the feature map circuit depth, the data map function for encoding the classical data, the quantum gate set and the order of expansion. We will go through each of these parameters in this tutorial, but before getting started, let us review the main concepts of the quantum feature map discussed in [1].\n",
