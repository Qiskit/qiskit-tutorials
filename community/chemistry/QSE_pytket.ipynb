    "## Quantum chemistry in the NISQ era, and the need for circuit optimization techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the expected applications of noisy, intemediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices is simulating quantum chemistry. A simple quantum chemistry question is \"Given how the electrons and nuclei of a particular molecule are arranged, what is the _energy_ of that configuration?\". By examining how the energy of the configuration changes as the nuclei and electrons are moved relative to one another, we can map out an _energy surface_. The configuration that minimizes the energy is a stable, equilibrium point for the molecule. Knowing this configuration (and its associated energy), we can deduce a variety of molecular properties, such as reaction rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most techniques for computing molecular energies on near term quantum devices rely on the [variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms5213). This algorithm uses a parameterized _ansatz_ $|{\\psi}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rangle$ to describe the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian $H$ for a given configuration. By examining how the expected energy $\\langle \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})|H| \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rangle/\\langle \\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rangle$ changes as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is varied, we can optimize the parameters to find an estimate for the ground state and its corresponding energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the VQE algorithm on actual hardware has two complications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficiently preparing the trial state $|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficiently measuring the terms in the Hamiltonian $H$ that describe the configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll focus on the problem of efficiently preparing the trial state. We do so for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* An accurate estimate of the ground state is all that's necessary to do the quantum subspace expansion technique to estimate excited state energies\n",
    "\n",
    "* To demonstrate the capabilies of Qiskit `Terra` and CQC's `t|ket〉`  compiler to reduce the circuit _resources_ (number of gates, depth, etc.) for the state preparation. In principle, these capabilities can be deployed for other problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing the resources is crucial in the NISQ era, because the noise present in NISQ devices dominates more for larger circuits (with more operations) and reduces the accuracy of the results. Therefore techniques which reduce circuit requirements can significantly improve the results on real hardware. Note that there are techniques, such as [qubit tapering](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08213), or ['gate-efficient' circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05057), which are useful for constructing a lower-resource circuit that could be run on _ideal_ hardware. In practice, even these \"resource-efficient\" circuits can be further optimized, especially when the imperfections and constraints of a real piece of hardware are taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, our approach utilizes Qiskit `Aqua` to generate a parameterized ansatz based on the [_Unitary Coupled Cluster, Single-Double_ (UCCSD) ansatz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupled_cluster). We then use Qiskit `Terra` and the `t|ket〉` compiler (as implemented in `pytket`) to optimize the circuit for that ansatz. We will show that the optimized ansatz requires substantially fewer circuit resources than the naive UCCSD ansatz. An application of our approach, we show how to use the quantum subspace expansion (QSE) technique to compute excited state energies for gaseous hydrogen (H$_{2}$) and lithium hydride (LiH)."

    "\n",
    "The VQE algorithm is often used to compute the _ground state_ energy of a given molecular configuration. However, knowing the energies of _excited states_ of the system is also useful. The energies of electronic excited states prove, in general, challenging to compute. Excited states are usually more _entangled_ than ground states and so require more computational resources to compute. While there exists techniques for efficiently representing certain classes of entangled states, in general, the complexity of the simulation will be non-trivial. This is a problem as it makes classical computation of the energy, to an appropriate accuracy, of many molecules impossible. \n",

    "This notebook demonstrates calculation of excited states of molecules using the [quantum subspace expanansion (QSE) technique](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.042308). The QSE technique uses an accurate estimate of the ground state energy of a given molecular configuration to estimate the energies of excited states.

By measuring these expectation values, we obtain estimates of $S_{jk}^{lm}$ and $(H')_{jk}^{lm}$, respectively.\n",

Looking at the first three of these, we find that at the equilibrium distance, these states are 0.11, 0.12 and 0.17 Ha higher in energy than the ground state, which is again in reasonable agreement with experimental data. Note the small kink in one of the excited states energy curve at a distance of approximately 1.2 Å. This indicates that our restriction to single electron excitations is not enough to provide an accurate description at this distance. Overall, the comparison with classically computed EOM-CCSD curves shows that this method reproduces excited state energies with good accuracy at most distances."
