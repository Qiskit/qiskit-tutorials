    "## Quantum Walk \n",
    "A quantum walk is the \"quantum version\" of a classical random walk. This means the coin function will be a Unitary gate ($U(2)$) which is non-random and reversible:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p+q = U \\in U(2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use a Hadamard gate for executing the coin function since it puts our qubits in a state of superposition, allowing for the  simulation of a coin based probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left [{\\begin{array}{rr}1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1\\\\ \\end{array}}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of random walks, continuous and discrete, and in this notebook we will use the discrete framework. In the discrete, unitary operations are made of coin and shift operators $U = SC$ which work in a state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is represented by an arbitrary undirected graph $G(V,E)$ where $V = {v_1, v_2, ..v_n}$ as nodes on the graph and $E = {(v_x, v_y) , ( v_i, v_j) …}$ as edges that combine different nodes together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum walk extends into a position space where each node $v_i$ has a certain valency $d_i$ and is split into $d_i$ subnodes. The shifting operator then acts as $S (v_i, a_i) = (v_j, a_j)$ and with the coin operator, are unitary gates which combine the probability amplitudes with individual subnodes under each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "A unitary of $v_i$ with valency $d_i$ can be represented as $(d_i \\times d_i)$. The total state of system is defined by the Hilbert space \n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = H_c + H_p$$ \n",

    "## The Coin Operator \n",
    "The first operation in a quantum random walk is the coin operator. The operator works by performing an arbitrary unitary transformation in the coin space which creates a rotation similar to “coin-flip” in random walk. This is namely the Hadamard gate, which models a balanced unitary coin. "

    "The coin register will continue interfering with its position state until it is measured, after all intermediate steps. The results are very different from random walks as it doesn’t converge to a Gaussian distribution, but rather evolves into an asymmetric probability distribution. This happens because the Hadamard coin operator treats each basis vectors, |↑> and |↓> , differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rightwards path interferes more destructively as it is multiplied by -1, however, the leftwards path undergoes more constructive interference and the system tends to take steps towards the left. To reach symmetric results, both base vectors will start in a superposition of states (between  |↑> and |↓>). Another way to reach symmetry is use a different coin operator which doesn’t bias the coin towards a certain base vector, such as the Y gate:\n",

    "\n",
    "An example of a real world problem that can be solved using quantum random walks is the mapping of enzymes to understand their evolution when in contact with mutagens. This problem only requires 33 nodes which can be mapped out on 7 qubit circuit. This increase in qubits would increase the total time to 49 seconds for 100 flips. This is a scalable model which can continue to grow to map more complex graphs to problems. \n",
