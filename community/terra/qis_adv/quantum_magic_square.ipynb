    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that quantum entanglement enables phenomena that we often see in science fiction, such as, (quantum) teleportation. Now, we will see that it can give rise to a kind of telepathy between two separated parties. Well, strictly speaking, quantum entanglement does not allow communication. However, it can be used for [Quantum Pseudo-Telepathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy), that is, parties sharing entangled states can be seen as if having some kind of communication to outside observers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we consider [the Magic Square Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_pseudo-telepathy), which is also known as *The Mermin-Peres Magic Square Game*. The magic square is a $3\\times 3$ matrix whose entries are either $0$ or $1$ such that the sum of each row is even, and the sum of each column is odd. Notice that such *magic* square is impossible: because there are odd number of entries, the sum of rows implies that the sum of $1$s must be even, but the sum of columns implies that it must be odd. A contradiction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The magic square game is played by a referee against two distant parties, say, Alice and Bob. In the game, the referee sends an integer $a \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ to Alice who must answer with the $a$-th row of the magic square, and an integer $b \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ to Bob, who must return the $b$-th column of the magic square. Alice and Bob win the game if the sum of entries of Alice's answer is even, the sum of Bob's answer is odd, and their intersecting answer is the same. Otherwise, the referee wins. Prior to the start of the game, Alice and Bob can meet to discuss their strategy and/or share random bits and entangled states, but they are not allowed to communicate during the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a simple strategy for Alice and Bob is to answer to the referee according to the following $3x3$ Boolean matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 1 & 0\\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 1\\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & ?\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, for $a = 1$ and $b = 2$, Alice's answer is $110$, while Bob's is $111$ and they win. However, they lose when the referee sends them $a = 3$ and $b=3$, because Alice's and Bob's answers do not satisfy the requirement. It can be shown that in the classical setting the winning probability of Alice and Bob is at most $8/9$ (in the above example, there are eight out of nine combinations of $a$ and $b$ that result in Alice and Bob winning the game).     \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum Winning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "However, with shared quantum states Alice and Bob can always win the game regardless of the values of $a$ and $b$. We show the winning strategy following [Brassard, Broadbent, and Tapp, 2004](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407221).\n",

    "The winning strategy described in this note is from [Brassard et al. 2004](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0407221), where there listed many other interesting games that can be accomplished with shared entanglement. The Magic Square game was first proposed by [Aravind, 2002](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0206070) based on the work of [Mermin, 1990](http://blog.umd.edu/phil858/files/2015/10/Mermin1990-2jvtdbh.pdf) and [Peres, 1990](http://blog.umd.edu/phil858/files/2015/10/Peres1990-2g8uzi6.pdf).\n",

    "[Gawron et al., 2008](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0801.4848v1.pdf) showed that the winning probabilities of Magic Square Games is related to the noise of the circuits. [Ozaydin, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03881) provided theoretical analysis of the winning probabilities of the thermal entangled state of the spin system for the Magic Square game: the higher the temperature, the lower the winning probability. Interestingly, [Pawela et al. 2013](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0064694) showed that it is possible to achieve higher winning probability under noisy circuits by employing Semidefinite Programming for noise mitigation.
