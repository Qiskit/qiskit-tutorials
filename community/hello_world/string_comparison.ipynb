    "Notice that each of the codes is represented by a bitstring of length 64. By comparing characters at the same position in the strings, we can see that Protozoan's is closer to Bacterial's than Yeast's. \n",
    "\n",
    "Exploiting quantum superposition, we can create quantum states by using only 7 qubits such that each of the quantum states corresponds to the genetic code of Yeast, Protozoan, and Bacterial. We then compare the closeness of their genetic codes by comparing their quantum states, which is made possible by the reversibility of quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reversibility of quantum circuit to test the similarity of quantum states works as follow. Assume that we can create a quantum superposition starting from all-zero states by a quantum circuit. Then by inverting the same quantum circuit and we give it the same quantum superposition as input, we will get exactly all-zero bits as the output. Now, when we give a similar quantum superposition as input to the inverted circuit, we can still get all-zero bits as the output with probability proportional to the similarity of the quantum states: the more similar, the more we observe all-zero bits. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, to decide which code (*Yeast's* *or* *Bacterial's*) is the most similar to the Protozoan, we can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first prepare the quantum state that encodes the Protozoan's\n",
    "2. We then use the quantum state as inputs to the inverted circuits that each prepare the quantum state of Yeast's and Bacterial's. Run and measure the circuits\n",
    "3. Output the name of the inverted circuit whose measurements result in more frequent measurements of all-zero bits. \n",

    "## Quantum Superposition for Bitstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "A qubit can be in a superposition of two basis states: \"0\" and \"1\" at the same time. Going further, two qubits can be in a superposition of four basis states: \"00\", \"01\", \"10\", and \"11\". In general, $n$ qubits can be in a superposition of $2^n$ (exponential in the number of qubits!) basis states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we show a simple example to create quantum superpositon for bitstrings and use them to compare the similarity between two bitstrings. This tutorial makes use the [quantum state initialization function](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial/blob/master/reference/tools/quantum_gates_and_linear_algebra.ipynb#Arbitrary-initialization) and **circuit inversion**. It also illustrates the power of loading data into quantum states. "

    "The technique of using circuit inversion to measure how close two quantum states has been used in many literature. For example, it is used for Quantum Kernel Estimation in [Havlicek et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.11326.pdf) for supervised learning. The idea of using quantum superposition to encode bistrings appeared in [Quantum Fingerprinting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0102001.pdf) where a quantum exponential advantage is shown for a communication task of comparing two bitstrings. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition of why combining a circuit which creates a quantum state with another circuit which is the inverted circuit of creating another quantum state can be used to measure how close two quantum states is as follow. \n",
    "\n",
    "All operations (except measurements) in quantum computers are unitary and hence, distance preserving. This means if we apply the same operation (or, circuit) to two states that are similar, the resulting states will also be similar. All those operations are also reversible, that means, if we know a circuit $C$ to create a particular quantum state $|\\phi\\rangle$ from the all-zero state, we can also design the circuit $C'$ that transforms back the quantum state $|\\phi\\rangle$ to the all-zero state. Now, if we apply $C'$ to a quantum state $|\\psi\\rangle$ which is similar to $|\\phi\\rangle$, we will obtain a quantum state which is also similar to the all-zero state. The distance of the resulting state to the all-zero state is the same as the distance between  $|\\phi\\rangle$ and $|\\psi\\rangle$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can notice that the similarity of two different quantum states can be very close to zero, and thus making difficult to find the discrepancies. However, we can use encoding techniques, such as, by [employing repetition code](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00990), to guarantee that different quantum states are separated far enough. In general, we can exploit error correcting codes, such as, [Justesen code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justesen_code), or [locality-sensitive hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) to encode bitstrings efficiently.
