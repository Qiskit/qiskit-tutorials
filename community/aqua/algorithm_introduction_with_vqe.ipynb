    "## _*Using Qiskit Aqua algorithms, a how to guide*_\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the `Qiskit Aqua` library to invoke an algorithm and process the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further information may be found for the algorithms in the online [Aqua documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/aqua/algorithms.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithms in Aqua can be created and run as usual in Python by constructing instances and calling methods. There is also a high level `run_algorithm` method that takes a configuration dictionary with data describing which algorithm to use, which components etc along with an InputInstance type to supply data to the algorithm. This latter approach is what we call `declarative` with the former, the regular Python way, `programmatic`. This tutorial will show both approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aqua has many `algorithms` for solving different problems. For some we also have classical algorithms, that take the exact same input data, to solve the problem. This can be useful in the near term as Quantum algorithms are developed since we are still at a stage where we can do classical comparison of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aqua also has various `components` which are dependent objects used by algorithms, such as variational forms, qfts, initial states etc. We will see more on this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly for developers we also have a collections of `circuits` and gates which can be used to help build out new components and algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will choose to show some of the main aspects of Aqua by solving a ground state energy problem."

All Aqua algorithms have the run method (it is defined by a base class which all algorithms extend) and while no parameters are need for classical algorithms a quantum algorithm will require a backend (quantum simulator or real device) on which it will be run. The `result` object returned is a dictionary. While the results fields can be different for algorithms solving different problems, and even within a given problem type there may be algorithm specific data returned, for a given problem the fields core to that problem are common across algorithms in order that different algorithms can be chosen to solve the same problem in a consistent fashion."

The name comes from a `CONFIGURATION` dictionary in the algorithm and this name is registered to the Aqua discovery framework so we can load the corresponding class and run it during the exceution of `run_algorithm`. `run_algorithm` requires the configuration dictionary and input data passed via an InputInstance class. For an energy problem the data is supplied via an EnergyInput (extends InputInstance), other problem types have their own specific InputInstance. `run_algorithm` returns the same dictionary as above (internally it calls the run() method of the algorithm and passes back the result)\n",
