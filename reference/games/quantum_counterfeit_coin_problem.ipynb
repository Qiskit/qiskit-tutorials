    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The counterfeit coin problem is a classic puzzle first proposed by E. D. Schell in the January 1945 edition of the *American Mathematical Monthly*:\n",
    "\n",
    ">You have eight similar coins and a beam balance. At most one coin is counterfeit and hence underweight. How can you detect whether there is an underweight coin, and if so, which one, using the balance only twice?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to the above puzzle is affirmative. What happens when we can use a quantum beam balance? \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a quantum beam balance and a counterfeit coin among $N$ coins, there is a quantum algorithm that can find the counterfeit coin by using the quantum balance only once (and independent of $N$, the number of coins!). On the other hand, any classical algorithm requires at least $\\Omega(\\log{N})$ uses of the beam balance. In general, for a given $k$ counterfeit coins of the same weight (but different from the majority of normal coins), there is [a quantum algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.0416.pdf) that queries the quantum beam balance for $O(k^{1/4})$ in contrast to any classical algorithm that requires $\\Omega(k\\log{(N/k)})$ queries to the beam balance. This is one of the wonders of quantum algorithms, in terms of query complexity that achieves quartic speed-up compared to its classical counterpart.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum Procedure\n",
    "Hereafter we describe a step-by-step procedure to program the Quantum Counterfeit Coin Problem for $k=1$ counterfeit coin with the IBM Q Experience. [Terhal and Smolin](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9705041.pdf) were the first to show that it is possible to identify the false coin with a single query to the quantum beam balance.  \n",

    "### Querying the quantum beam balance\n",
    "\n",
    "As in a classical algorithm to find the false coin, we will use the balance by placing the same number of coins on the left and right pans of the beam. The difference is that in a quantum algorithm, we can query the beam balance in superposition. To query the quantum beam balance, we use a binary query string to encode coins placed on the pans; namely, the binary string `01101010` means to place coins whose indices are 1, 2, 4, and 6 on the pans, while the binary string `01110111` means to place all coins but those with indices 0 and 4 on the pans. Notice that we do not care how the selected coins are placed on the left and right pans, because their results are the same: it is balanced when no false coin is included, and tilted otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, because the number of coins is $8$ and the index of false coin is $3$, the query `01101010` will result in balanced (or, $0$), while the query `01110111` will result in tilted (or, $1$). Using two quantum registers to query the quantum balance, where the first register is for the query string and the second register for the result of the quantum balance, we can write the query to the quantum balance (omitting the normalization of the amplitudes): \n",

Let $x \\in \\left\\{0,1\\right\\}^N$ be the $N$-bit query string (that contains even number of $1$s), and let $e_k \\in \\left\\{0,1\\right\\}^N$ be the binary string which is $1$ at the index of the false coin and $0$ otherwise.

    "## About Quantum Counterfeit Coin Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The case when there is a single false coin, as presented in this notebook, is essentially [the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/S0097539796300921), and the single-query coin-weighing algorithm was first presented in 1997 by [Terhal and Smolin](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9705041.pdf). The Quantum Counterfeit Coin Problem for $k > 1$ in general is studied by [Iwama et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1009.0416.pdf) Whether there exists a quantum algorithm that only needs $o(k^{1/4})$ queries to identify all the false coins remains an open question.
