    "Integer factorisation is the decomposition of an composite integer into a product of smaller integers, for example, the integer $100$ can be factored into $10 \\times 10$. If these factors are restricted to prime numbers, the process is called prime factorisation, for example, the prime factorisation of $100$ is $2 \\times 2 \\times 5 \\times 5$. \n",

    "## Shor's Algorithm <a id='shorsalgorithm'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm, named after mathematician Peter Shor, is a polynomial time quantum algorithm for integer factorisation formulated in [1994](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0097539795293172). It is arguably the most dramatic example of how the paradigm of quantum computing changed our perception of which computational problems should be considered tractable, motivating the study of new quantum algorithms and efforts to design and construct quantum computers. It also has expedited research into new cryptosystems not based on integer factorisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm has been experimentally realised by multiple teams for specific composite integers. The composite $15$ was first factored into $3 \\times 5$ in [2001](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v414/n6866/full/414883a.html) using seven NMR qubits, and has since been implemented using four photon qubits in 2007 by [two](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.250504) [teams](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.99.250505), three solid state qubits in [2012](https://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v8/n10/full/nphys2385.html) and five trapped ion qubits in [2016](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6277/1068). The composite $21$ has also been factored into $3 \\times 7$ in [2012](http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v6/n11/full/nphoton.2012.259.html) using a photon qubit and qutrit (a three level system). Note that these experimental demonstrations rely on significant optimisations of Shor's algorithm based on apriori knowledge of the expected results. In general, [$2 + \\frac{3}{2}\\log_2N$](https://link-springer-com.virtual.anu.edu.au/chapter/10.1007/3-540-49208-9_15) qubits are needed to factor the composite integer $N$, meaning at least $1,154$ qubits would be needed to factor $RSA-768$ above.\n"

    "The number theory that underlines Shor's algorithm relates to periodic modulo sequences. Let's have a look at an example of such a sequence. Consider the sequence of the powers of two: \n",
    "$$1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, ...$$\n",

    "This is a modulo sequence that repeats every four numbers, that is, a periodic modulo sequence with a period of four.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduction of factorisation of $N$ to the problem of finding the period of an integer $x$ less than $N$ and greater than $1$ depends on the following result from number theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The function $\\mathcal{F}(a) = x^a \\bmod N$ is a periodic function, where $x$ is an integer coprime to $N$ and $a \\ge 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that two numbers are coprime, if the only positive integer that divides both of them is 1. This is equivalent to their greatest common divisor being 1. For example, 8 and 15 are coprime, as they don't share any common factors (other than 1). However, 9 and 15 are not coprime, since they are both divisible by 3 (and 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "> Since $\\mathcal{F}(a)$ is a periodic function, it has some period $r$. Knowing that $x^0 \\bmod N = 1$, this means that $x^r \\bmod N = 1$ since the function is periodic, and thus $r$ is just the first nonzero power where $x^r = 1 (\\bmod N)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this information and through the following algebraic manipulation: \n",
    "$$ x^r \\equiv 1 \\bmod N $$\n",
    "$$ x^r = (x^{r/2})^2 \\equiv 1 \\bmod N $$\n",
    "$$ (x^{r/2})^2 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\bmod N $$\n",
    "and if $r$ is an even number:\n",
    "$$ (x^{r/2} + 1)(x^{r/2} - 1) \\equiv 0 \\bmod N $$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this, the product $(x^{r/2} + 1)(x^{r/2} - 1)$ is an integer multiple of $N$, the number to be factored. Thus, so long as $(x^{r/2} + 1)$ or $(x^{r/2} - 1)$ is not a multiple of $N$, then at least one of $(x^{r/2} + 1)$ or $(x^{r/2} - 1)$ must have a nontrivial factor in common with $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So computing $\\text{gcd}(x^{r/2} - 1, N)$ and $\\text{gcd}(x^{r/2} + 1, N)$ will obtain a factor of $N$, where $\\text{gcd}$ is the greatest common denominator function, which can be calculated by the polynomial time [Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm). "
