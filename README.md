Welcome to the [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/) IQX Tutorials!

In this repository, we've put together a collection of Jupyter notebooks aimed
at teaching people who want to use Qiskit for writing quantum computing
programs, and executing them on one of several backends (online quantum
processors, online simulators, and local simulators). The online quantum
processors are the [IBM Q](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com) devices.

For our community-contributed tutorials, please check out the
[qiskit-community-tutorials](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-community-tutorials)
repository.

## Installation

The notebooks for these tutorials can be viewed here on GitHub...but for the
full experience, you'll want to interact with them!  The easiest way to do this
is by logging into the [IBM Quantum
Experience](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/), which lets you use Jupyter
notebooks, including these tutorials, via the web.

Please refer to this [installation guide](INSTALL.md) for setting up Qiskit and
the tutorials on your own machine (this is the recommended way).

## Contents

We've collected a core reference set of notebooks in this section outlining the
features of Qiskit. We will be keeping them up to date with the latest Qiskit
version.

- [Basics](qiskit/fundamentals) is for those who are getting started.
- [Terra](qiskit/advanced/terra) is for those who want to study circuits.
- [Aer](qiskit/advanced/aer) is for those who want to simulate quantum circuits.
- [Ignis](qiskit/advanced/ignis) is for those who want to study noise.
- [Aqua](qiskit/advanced/aqua) is for those who want to develop applications on NISQ computers.

To go through the Qiskit examples, load up the
[start_here.ipynb](qiskit/1_start_here.ipynb) notebook and start seeing how
Qiskit works.
