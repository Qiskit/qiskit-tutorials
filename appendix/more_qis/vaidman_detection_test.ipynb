    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "One surprising result of quantum mechanics is the ability to measure something without ever directly \"observing\" it. This interaction-free measurement cannot be reproduced in classical mechanics. The prototypical example is the [Elitzur–Vaidman Bomb Experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur%E2%80%93Vaidman_bomb_tester) - in which one wants to test whether bombs are active without detonating them. In this example we will test whether an unknown operation is null (the identity) or an X gate, corresponding to a dud or a live bomb.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Algorithm\n",
    "The algorithm will use two qubits, $q_1$ and $q_2$, as well as a small parameter, $\\epsilon = \\frac{\\pi}{n}$ for some integer $n$. Call the unknown gate, which is either the identity or an X gate, $G$, and assume we have it in a controlled form. The algorithm is then:\n",
    "1. Start with both $q_1$ and $q_2$ in the $|0\\rangle$ state\n",
    "2. Rotate $q_1$ by $\\epsilon$ about the Y axis\n",
    "3. Apply a controlled $G$ on $q_2$, conditioned on $q_1$\n",
    "4. Measure $q_2$\n",
    "5. Repeat (2-4) $n$ times\n",
    "6. Measure $q_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "![Algorithm Depiction](http://i.imgur.com/sG8Pa3J.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation and proof of correctness\n",
    "There are two cases: Either the gate is the identity (a dud), or it is an X gate (a live bomb).\n",
    "#### Case 1: Dud\n",
    "After rotation, $q_1$ is now approximately\n",
    "$$q_1 \\approx |0\\rangle + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} |1\\rangle$$\n",
    "Since the unknown gate is the identity, the controlled gate leaves the two qubit state separable,\n",
    "$$q_1 \\times q_2 \\approx (|0\\rangle + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} |1\\rangle) \\times |0\\rangle$$\n",
    "and measurement is trivial (we will always measure $|0\\rangle$ for $q_2$).\n",
    "Repetition will not change this result - we will always keep separability and $q_2$ will remain in $|0\\rangle$.\n",
    "After n steps, $q_1$ will flip by $\\pi$ to $|1\\rangle$, and so measuring it will certainly yield $1$. Therefore, the output register for a dud bomb will read:\n",
    "$$000...01$$\n",
    "#### Case 2: Live\n",
    "Again, after rotation, $q_1$ is now approximately\n",
    "$$q_1 \\approx |0\\rangle + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} |1\\rangle$$\n",
    "But, since the unknown gate is now an X gate, the combined state after $G$ is now\n",
    "$$q_1 \\times q_2 \\approx |00\\rangle + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} |11\\rangle$$\n",
    "Measuring $q_2$ now might yield $1$, in which case we have \"measured\" the live bomb (obtained a result which differs from that of a dud) and it explodes. However, this only happens with a probability proportional to $\\epsilon^2$. In the vast majority of cases, we will measure $0$ and the entire system will collapse back to\n",
    "$$q_1 \\times q_2 = |00\\rangle$$\n",
    "After every step, the system will most likely return to the original state, and the final measurement of $q_1$ will yield $0$. Therefore, the most likely outcome of a live bomb is\n",
    "$$000...00$$\n",
    "which will identify a live bomb without ever \"measuring\" it. If we ever obtain a 1 in the bits preceding the final bit, we will have detonated the bomb, but this will only happen with probability of order\n",
    "$$P \\propto n \\epsilon^2 \\propto \\epsilon$$\n",
    "This probability may be made arbitrarily small at the cost of an arbitrarily long circuit."
