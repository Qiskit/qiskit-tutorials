## Teach Me QISKit Award 2018: Top Submissions

This folder contains the top submissions of the Teach Me QISKit Award 2018.
Most of the tutorials were written and tested with [qiskit-core](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-core)
version 0.4.15 (previously known as qiskit-sdk-py).

Here is the list of the top submissions (in alphabetical order).
