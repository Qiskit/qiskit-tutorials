    "## Running QISKit Jupyter Notebooks using the IBM Data Science Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "This article shows you how to set up and run [QISKit](https://www.qiskit.org/) Jupyter notebooks using [IBM Data Science Experience](https://datascience.ibm.com/) (IBM DSX), thanks to Doug McClure ([@dtmcclure](https://github.com/dtmcclure)) and Ninad Sathaye ([@sathayen](https://github.com/sathayen/)). The latest version of this notebook is available [here](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-tutorial), where you can find all the other QISKit tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About IBM Data Science Experience\n",
    "\n",
    "IBM DSX is an interactive, collaborative, cloud-based environment where data scientists can use multiple tools to activate their insights.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are just starting with QISKit and looking for a webhosted Jupyter notebook environment, IBM DSX is an excellent option. It is fairly easy to get your quantum notebook running in the Jupyter notebook environment provided by IBM DSX. Moreover, it provides a platform where you can create your notebooks, invite fellow researchers to collaborate, or simply share your work within the community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- You must sign up for the IBM Data Science Experience ([IBM DSX](https://datascience.ibm.com/)). Tip: It is often convenient to use an IBM ID when signing up. If you do not have one already, [create it first](https://www.ibm.com/account/us-en/signup/register.html).\n",
    "- You also need an account for the IBM Quantum Experience ([IBM QX](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx)). You can optionally use the IBM ID here as well. This account is required so that you can connect to the API using an 'API TOKEN'. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. [Setup QISKit](#setup)\n",
    "2. [Test QISKit](#test)\n",
    "3. [Run QISKit](#run) "

    "2. Log into the [IBM DSX](https://datascience.ibm.com/)\n",
    "3. Create a new notebook from your downloaded DSX.ipynb\n",
    "4. Get your IBM QX API token\n",
    "  - Logon to the [IBM QX](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx)\n",
    "  - Click on your username on the top right, and select *My Account*\n",
    "  - Copy the token displayed under *Advanced*. Make sure it is enclosed in quotes \"\"\n",
    "5. Update the value *`\"PUT_YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE\"`* in the code cell with the API token you just copied in previous step\n",
    "  - **NOTE:** If you are sharing this notebook, MAKE SURE TO REMOVE the API token string before sharing! \n",
