    "This program is a 'Hello World' type introduction to the world of quantum computing. It introduces some of the basic concepts of quantum computing in a way that is informative, fun, and engaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the functions of quantum computers - more specifically of the qubits that comprise the quantum computer - is the ability to generate truly random numbers. Classical random number generators are often [pseudo-random](https://www.random.org/randomness), meaning that they are not truly random. Instead, these numbers are often generated using a seed, such as the curent timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can obtain a random number from a quantum computer by polling a single qubit. In doing so, the qubit 'chooses' to be either a 0 or a 1 in a purely random way. Repeating this polling many times and averaging the results will tend towards an average value of 0.5. That is the method we'll use for this program.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what can we use our random number for? Certainly a great number of important things, but also to try and settle one of the great debates of our time: Laurel or Yanny?\n",
    "\n",
    "In May 2018, an audio clip was discovered on Vocabulary.com accompanying the word [laurel](https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/laurel). The clip went viral as part of a tweet, and listeners from around the world weighed in on what they thought they heard. Some heard the intended word 'laurel' while others heard 'yanny'. There are some interesting notes on why this is the case in [this Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/yanny-and-laurel-true-history).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the jury is still out on exactly what word people are hearing, let's ask a quantum computer what it thinks! The first step is to import the required libraries and initialize the quantum and classical registers that will be used for this program. "
